# Hallucinations and Efficiency of GenAI for CISO-Led Security Operations

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive assessment framework for evaluating Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities in cybersecurity operations. The framework provides structured criteria to assess how effectively GenAI tools can support Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and security teams across multiple security dimensions.

## Purpose

The assessment framework aims to:
- Evaluate GenAI's practical capabilities in real-world security scenarios
- Identify potential hallucination risks and efficiency gaps in AI-assisted security operations
- Provide standardized criteria for comparing different GenAI solutions
- Guide organizations in implementing AI-enhanced security operations

## Framework Structure

The assessment framework is organized into four main security dimensions:

### 1. **Human Security (HumSec)**
- Employee lifecycle management
- Incident response and behavior management
- Access control
- Contract compliance management

### 2. **Physical Security (PhySec)**
- Access control and authorization
- Incident management and response
- Employee and contractor security
- Physical security policies and compliance

### 3. **Operational Security (OpSec)**
- Network and information systems security policy
- Cybersecurity risk analysis
- Cyber incident management
- Business continuity
- Access control

### 4. **Technical Security (TechSec)**
- Network security
- Encryption and data protection
- Access control
- Incident management
- Software and hardware management
- Data backup management
- Website and application security
- Audit and monitoring

## Assessment Categories

Each security sub-dimension is evaluated across seven key categories:

1. **Ability to analyze different file formats** - Processing capabilities for various document and data formats
2. **Accuracy of analysis** - Precision in identifying security-relevant information
3. **Extraction of structured information** - Converting unstructured data into actionable formats
4. **Searching and filtering capabilities** - Efficiency in finding specific security events
5. **Detection of anomalies and incidents** - Identifying security violations and unusual patterns
6. **Speed and performance** - Processing efficiency and scalability
7. **Data visualization** - Generating meaningful visual representations of security data

## Use Cases

This framework can be used to:
- Benchmark GenAI tools for security operations
- Develop RFPs for AI-enhanced security solutions
- Create training scenarios for security teams
- Establish performance metrics for AI implementation
- Guide security automation initiatives

## Key Assessment Areas

### Critical Capabilities Evaluated:
- Multi-format file processing (.txt, .docx, .pdf, .csv, .xlsx, .json, .log, .pcap, .evtx)
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Incident response automation
- Security policy analysis
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Access control management
- Audit trail analysis

## Methodology

The assessment framework uses specific, measurable criteria to evaluate GenAI performance, including:
- Processing speed metrics (e.g., events per second)
- File size handling capabilities (e.g., 100MB, 500MB, 1GB files)
- Accuracy in identifying security violations
- Time-to-detection for critical incidents
- Visualization quality and usefulness

## Expected Outcomes

Organizations using this framework can:
1. Objectively assess GenAI tool capabilities
2. Identify gaps in current AI security implementations
3. Make informed decisions about AI adoption in security operations
4. Reduce false positives and hallucinations in AI-assisted threat detection
5. Improve overall security posture through intelligent automation
